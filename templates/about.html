<h3>Hi! I'm Olivia...</h3>
<p>I started this page as a way to combine two things I love: philosophy and software engineering. I created this website as a Senior Project for my capstone at BYU-I. 
    By the time you are seeing this, I will hopefully have gotten my degree in software engineering with an emphasis in software managment and a minor in philosophy.
    
</p>
<h3>Why philosophy?</h3>
<p>I took my first philosophy course my very first semester, and I was HOOKED! The first day of class we discussed the Trolley Car Problem. I found it so fascinating that the things that we assume we have an answer to
    (such as what is right and wrong) are actually not very apparent or at least flawed in our sub-conscious assumptions. From that semester on, I threw myself as deep into the philosphy program as I could. I TAed for 
    three courses multiple times each for three years (a total of 16 classes), spent a semester bi-weekly meeting with the philosophy professors to rewrite their Intro class, wrote content, designed resources, instituted 
    systems to help students, tutor, and substituted for absent professors for a total of three weeks worth of classes. I became close friends with each of the PhD Oxford level and successful authors. I hang out at their 
    houses and had lunch with them several times a week. I could not get enough philosophy! 
    <br>
    <br>
    Not only has my philosophical journey been full of opportunites and just a mental blast, but it made a huge difference in my career. My logic class is what inspired me to be a software engineer! I had so much fun controrting 
    statements and thinking ahead to solve problems to puzzles that I thought, "what career has something like this?". I shortly after took my first coding class and, while it was difficult, it tickled my brain in a similar way. 
    I have continued my philosophical endeaver throughout college and seen how it has helped me with coding. Philosophy is a tool to help me sharpen my brain and quickly think a solution all the way to the end to see if it would work. 
    I can quickly see holes or flaws in an idea. I can ask questions that no one has thought of before. I can comprehend difficult ideas. I can teach myself complex theories and systems. As my professor forwarded onto the VP of the school, I 
    have told others that my philosophy classes have done just as much for my software engineering education, and in some cases more than, my actual software engineering classes.

<h3>Why this project?</h3>
<p>I find that thought experiments are some of the best way to open a mind up to a philosophical problem. Even those who have no exposure or background in philosophy can participate! They feel excited and their mind is open to theories that may go with the experiment. 
<br>
<br>
There are some particular thought experiments that I have taken an interest in. One of them being the trolly car problem, while it was originally designed to show the participants that utilitarianism is what most people choose in a number conundrum, I have found otherwise.
While administering the thought experiment to others, I have not only seen differing answers but a pattern amongst particular people. Based on the choices they made and the side remarks they would give, I could tell that they gravitated towards a particular ethical theory. 
I tested this by guiding friends and family through the trolly car problem and taking a mental note on their answers and side comments or reasoning behind the answers. Then at the end I would "perscribe" an ethical theory to them. Almost every time, the person would agree that 
they do make their moral decisions based on the theory I desrcibed to them. Thus, I wanted to share this pattern or process of perscribing a ethical theory to more people in an online format.
