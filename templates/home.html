<p>Have you ever pondered the nature of good or what makes something good versus bad? Should you tell your friend that dress makes her look fat or lie? If so, then you've come to the right place.
     Our website is dedicated to exploring some of the most fascinating and thought-provoking ideas in the branch of philosophy of ethics through the use of thought experiments.
     Whether you're a seasoned philosopher or a curious beginner, our thought experiments are sure to spark your imagination and deepen your understanding of the world.</p>
<h3>What is a thought experiment?</h3>
<p>A thought experiment is a hypothetical scenario created to explore a complex idea or question. These scenarios are designed to challenge our assumptions, reveal inconsistencies in our beliefs, and push us to think deeply about the world around us.
    It is similar to a scientific experiment
    but with things that cannot be or should not be (for ethical reasons) experimented on. Thought experiments allow the thinker
    to change variables, create a base case, and have unlimited participants.

<h3>What is philosophy?</h3>
<p>Philosophy comes from the two Greek words philein and sophia, which means love of wisdom. Philosophy is a branch of study that seeks to understand fundamental questions about the nature of reality, 
    existence, knowledge, values, ethics, and the human experience. It involves critical thinking, reasoning, and questioning in order to explore and understand concepts and ideas that shape our 
    understanding of the world around us. Interestingly, most fields of study (math, physics, etc) started off as a part of philosophy. Today, there are four main branches: metaphysics (what is real), 
    epistomology (how do we know what we know), ethics (what is right and wrong), and logic (how do we reason). Some people also include aesthetics, which is the discussion of beauty. </p>
