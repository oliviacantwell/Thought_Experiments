<h2 id="one">What is ethics?</h2>
<p>Morals are the principles that govern what is right and wrong. Ethics is the action or rules that enact morality. 
    This can include behavior, thought, and/or intent. In philosophy, the study of ethics is our attempt to discover what 
    those rules of conduct should be in order to accurately encapsulate morality. Of course first we would need to understand the 
    nature of morality, which is still under debate. Philosophers have also framed this area of study in the form of the question, "what ought we to do?"
    </p>
    <br>
<h2>Relativism verus Objectivism</h2>
<p>Of course one of the very first things to discuss is if we all even have to agree on morality. Some philosophers have claimed that morality is relative 
    to the individual (subjectivism) or group of individuals (cultural relativism). This means that morality varies from person to person or culture to culture. 
    There is no universal "right answer". For example, in some Eskimo societies they beleive that the elderly should be honorably killed. This is a sign of respect 
    to reduce their suffering to to decrease the econimic burden that they may place on fellow citizens. But in other cultures failing to take proper care of the seniors 
    is selfish, as they once cared for the current generation when they were helpless infants. Which is correct for all cultures? In some areas of the world where resources 
    are much more scarce, the former would probably be judged as more "right" for that culture or scenario. An example of individual subjectivism could be a person's beleif on
    alcohol. For someone that has a genetic or behavioral disposition to misuse alcohol, abstenance would be the moral thing for that individual. However, it is not necessarily
    morally wrong for everyone else who has the discipline to drink in moderation to obstain. 
    <br><br>One of the strong arguments for relativism is that it encourages non-judgmental behavior. There is no room to critisize someone else's behavior or beleifs. It promotes understanding, tolerance,
    and individuality. Everyone is free to do what they feel is best for their circumstance. This also allows for culteral diversity. Different cultures have different moral codes, and there is no objective 
    way to determine which code is better or worse than others.
    One of the arguments against relativism points out that there would be no basis for moral criticism. For example, if someone beleived it to be morally just to kill your mother because she was ugly, there could be 
    no form of punishment or reconciliation. Everyone could do as they please on the basis of "following their heart", so to speak. Any moral belief or practice, no matter how harmful or unjust, could be defended on the 
    grounds that it is part of a particular culture or individuals' moral code. Additionally, this would undermine what we have considered as moral progress. For example, most beleive that the abolition of slavery was an
    improvement in our society. But this would be difficult to explain if one embraced relativism. Slavery could be restored with no justification to do otherwise. 
    <br><br>Objectivism is the belief that there are moral values that exist independent of individuals. These values can be discovered rationally and apply to everyone. This would solve the issues found in ethical relativism. Individuals 
    can be held accountable for their actions and be protected from one another. Of course then the question arises, what is it that we are supposed to do? What is the right and wrong thing to do? Philosophers have come up with many ideas 
    as to what they reason morality to be. There are two branches of thought: consequentialism and doentology.
</p>
<br>
<hr>
<h2 id="two">Consequentialism</h2>
<p>This is the branch of thought that beleives that what is right is based on the consequences of the act. For example, if a Nazi soldier were to knock on your door and ask if you have Jews hiding in your basement, you would lie. This is because the consequences 
    of telling the truth would be the death of the innocent Jews that trusted you. This also means that intention or the act itself doesn't necessarily matter. What makes the act right is the effects of the act. 
</p>
<br>
<h3 id="three">Utilitarianism</h3>
<p>Utilitarianism is a moral theory that evaluates the ethical worth of an action based on its ability to maximize happiness or pleasure and minimize pain or suffering for the greatest number of people. According to this theory, the best course of action is the one that produces the greatest amount of overall happiness or pleasure, and the least amount of overall suffering or pain.
    This means that some acts that may be deemed as immoral would be permissable if it is net positive in its effects. For example, if there was a man who was the only one that knew the passcode to stop an atomic bomb from destroying New York, it would be permissable to torture him to get those codes. This is because the pain from his toture is less than the pain that will be caused 
    by killing millions of innocent civilians. It also allows for lying by telling your wife that the dress does not make her look fat...
</p>
<p>Critics of utilitarianism argue that it can lead to morally problematic decisions if the happiness of the majority is achieved at the expense of (1)the minority or (2) if the happiness of future generations is disregarded. The first objection is less prominent in large societies. However, utilitarianism can be 
    very harmful to a few people. For example, it would allow for slavery and other foul behaviors, as long as the benefit outweighs the cost. Second, it only worries about the pain/happiness of the now or nearby future. It does not have any regards for far into the future. For example, we could destroy the environment
    for our benefit, even though it could cause suffering and exstinctions a few hundred years from now.
</p>
<br>
<h3 id="four">Egoism</h3>
<p>Ethical egoism is a moral theory that holds that individuals should act in their own self-interest, seeking to maximize their own happiness or pleasure, regardless of the impact on others. According to this theory, each person has a moral obligation to pursue their own self-interest, even if it conflicts with the interests of others.
    Some proponents of ethical egoism argue that it can lead to a more peaceful and prosperous society, as individuals who pursue their own self-interest will be more productive and efficient. They argue that individuals who act in their own self-interest will naturally cooperate with others, as cooperation can often lead to greater mutual benefit.
</p>
<p>It is important to note the difference between ethical and psychological egoism. 
    Ethical egoism is prescriptive in nature, as it tells individuals what they ought to do. It is concerned with how people should behave in order to lead a good and moral life. 
    Psychological egoism, on the other hand, is a descriptive theory of human motivation that asserts that people always act in their own self-interest, regardless of whether they are aware of it or not. It is concerned with how people actually behave, 
    rather than how they should behave. Psychological egoism holds that individuals always do pursue their own self-interest, whether they are aware of it or not. It is descriptive in nature, as it describes how people behave, rather than prescribing how they should behave. 
    If psychological egoism is indeed the case, then there would be no escaping ethical egoism. This is because if someone were to claim to be acting under, say, virtue ethics and trying to be selfless, this would not be the case and would be actually acting under their own interest.
    Thus the only ethical theory that would be possible to live by would be ethical egoism.
</p>
<p>One of the main criticisms of ethical egoism is that it does not take into account the interests of others, which can lead to selfish and harmful behavior. Critics argue that it is important to consider the interests of others in making moral decisions, and that the pursuit of self-interest should not come at the expense of the well-being of others.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="five">Social Contract Theory</h3>
<p>Ethical social contract theory is a philosophical framework that attempts to provide a basis for moral and ethical principles that guide individual behavior and social interactions.
    The basic premise of social contract theory is that people are naturally self-interested and in a state of anarchy in which there are no laws or government. In this state, individuals have complete freedom to do as they please, which can lead to chaos and conflict. To avoid this, individuals agree to give up some of their freedoms and create a government that will protect them and their property.</p>

<p>Ethical social contract theory proposes that ethical and moral principles arise from a hypothetical agreement between individuals to live together in a society. This agreement is based on the understanding that each individual has certain rights and obligations, and that everyone should adhere to a set of common principles that promote the well-being of all members of society.
    One of the key principles of ethical social contract theory is the idea of reciprocity. This principle states that individuals should treat others as they would like to be treated, and that they should follow a set of moral rules that apply equally to all members of society. This principle is based on the belief that individuals have a moral duty to act in ways that promote the well-being of others, and that this duty is reciprocal. 
</p>
<p>In the <a href="/prisoner">"Prisoner's Dilemma"</a>, social contract theory would perscribe that both parties consistently pick "split" so that everyone gets an equal share. By cooporating and giving up a possible higher reward, to makes sure that there is no risk for someone to be disadvantaged</p>
<p>Similar to utilitarianism, critics point out that ethical social contract theory does not sufficiently account for individual rights and liberties. They argue that the social contract may be used to justify the suppression of individual freedoms in the name of the collective good. Another objection is that the theory gives a general principle for right and wrong, but is not detailed enough to instruct 
    an individual on what choice to make in a given scenario.
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="six">Deontology</h2>
<p>This is the branch in ethics that includes theories that focus on the ethical principles and duties that guide human action, rather than on the consequences of those actions. In other words, it focuses on the act itself rather than the effects or outcome of the act. 
    According to deontological ethics, there are certain moral rules and duties that are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their consequences.
    Deontologists believe that actions are intrinsically right or wrong based on whether they adhere to universal moral principles or duties, such as the duty to tell the truth or the duty to respect the autonomy of others. These principles and duties are seen as objectively true 
    and binding on all individuals, regardless of their personal preferences or circumstances.</p>

    <p>Critics of deontological ethics argue that it can be rigid and inflexible, and that it may not always provide clear guidance for ethical decision-making in complex situations. They also argue that it may not take into account the consequences of actions, which can be an important factor in determining whether an action is morally right or wrong.</p>

<br>
<h3 id="seven">Kantianism</h3>
<p>Kantianism is a philosophical theory developed by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant in the late 18th century. It focuses on the moral duties and obligations that individuals have towards others. </p>
<p>The theory is based around categorical imperatives, which are principles that determin what is morally right and wrong. It applies to everyone, regardless of consequences. Scholars have simplified Kant's writtings into 3 main categorical imperatives. 
    <br>The first is the "Formula of Universal Law," which states that an action is morally right if and only if its maxim (the principle or rule that the agent is acting on) can be willed as a universal law of nature. This formulation is based on the idea that moral principles must be universal and applicable to all rational beings. 
    In other words, the right thing to do is what can be reasonably willed for everyone to follow. For example, a homeless man may say that he thinks it is okay to steal food if he is hungry. But if this were to become a universal rule, then places would go out of business because they are regularly getting robbed by homeless people.
</p>
<p>Another formulation of the categorical imperative is the "Formula of Humanity," which states that an action is morally right if it treats human beings, including oneself, as ends in themselves and not merely as means to an end. This formulation emphasizes the importance of respecting the inherent worth and dignity of all human beings. In other words, people 
    should not be treated as objects.
</p>
<p>A third formulation of the categorical imperative is the "Formula of Autonomy," which states that an action is morally right if it is chosen freely and autonomously by the agent, without being determined by external factors such as coercion or manipulation. The agent should do the right thing out of a sense of duty, not out of fear of consequences.</p>
<p>Based on these three categorical imperatives, Kant explains that we can reason out the right thing to do in any given scenario. We create a "maxim" (or a guiding rule that tells the agent what to do in the scenario). He argued that moral truths are accessible to all rational beings through the use of reason, and that moral principles 
    can be derived from pure reason alone, without the need for empirical observation.</p>
<p>One of the objections to this theory is that it seems to discourage actions that intuitively seem to be the right thing to do.
    For example, imagine someone has the codes to stop a nuclear bomb from going off in New York city. It intuitively seems like the right thing
    to do to torture the man for the codes. However, Kant would point out that we are using the man merely as a means to get the codes. And someone could use
    the maxim "torture when it will cause good" to allow for unjust scenarios, like slavery or disecting the disabled for their organs.
</p>
<br>
<h3 id="eight">Virtue Ethics</h3>
<p>Virtue ethics is an ethical theory that focuses on the character of the individual rather than on rules or consequences. It emphasizes the development of virtues, or positive character traits, such as courage, honesty, generosity, and compassion, as the key to living a good life and making ethical decisions.
<br>In virtue ethics, the focus is on what kind of person one should be, rather than on what one should do in a particular situation. It argues that individuals should cultivate virtues and aim to live a virtuous life, and that this will naturally lead to ethical behavior.
<br> The origin of virtue ethics can be traced back to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who believed that the key to living a good life is to cultivate virtues and achieve a state of eudaimonia, or flourishing. According to Aristotle, virtues are habits or dispositions that enable individuals to act in accordance with reason and achieve a state of balance or moderation.</p>

<p>Aristotle guided agents to make decisions or cultivate attributes according to the "golden mean". This states that we should not exercise a virtue into extremities (whether it be in excess or difficiency), for then it becomes a vice. 
    For example, is it good to be kind. A deficiency of being kind is being selfish. An excess would be to allow yourself to be walked all over and submissive. Thus, the golden mean or right amount of kindness should be exercised. 
</p>

<p>Critics argue that while it does focus on some of the most important aspects of morality and gives grace to those that are trying, it does not tell an individual clearly what to do in a given situation. For example, should a hungry man steal bread to feed his family?
    If he steals, that makes him a theif. But if he does not steal, that makes him a bad father. So either way, he is developing his character in a negative sense, and the correct thing to do is not clear.
</p>
<br>
<h3 id="nine">Divine Command Theory</h3>
<p>Divine command theory holds that moral principles are derived from the commands or decrees of God or gods. According to this theory, moral obligations are based on the divine will or law, and actions are right or wrong based on whether they conform to or violate these divine commands.
    In other words, divine command theory asserts that the source of morality is not reason, human nature, or societal conventions, but rather the divine will. This aligns well with most religious beliefs. 
</p>

<p>There are a number of problems with this theory, including the question of how one can know what God's commands are, and how one can determine whether a particular command is truly from God or is merely a human invention. Additionally, critics argue that it can lead to the justification of immoral actions if they are seen as being commanded by God or gods.
    The only way to escape this is by claiming that rather than what is good is what God commands, what God commands is what is good. In other words, there is an objective universal set of morals and God just reveals them to us. However, some 
    people would be the idea that there is a guiding force above God to be sacreligious. Additionally, this means we could hypothetically discover or reason those rules without the need of God, and thus can disregard religion.
