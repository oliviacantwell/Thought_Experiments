<h2>What is ethics?</h2>
<p>Morals are the principles that govern what is right and wrong. Ethics is the action or rules that enact morality. 
    This can include behavior, thought, and/or intent. In philosophy, the study of ethics is our attempt to discover what 
    those rules of conduct should be in order to accurately encapsulate morality. Of course first we would need to understand the 
    nature of morality, which is still under debate. Philosophers have also framed this area of study in the form of the question, "what ought we to do?"
    </p>
<h3>Relativism verus Objectivism</h3>
<p>Of course one of the very first things to discuss is if we all even have to agree on morality. Some philosophers have claimed that morality is relative 
    to the individual (subjectivism) or group of individuals (cultural relativism). This means that morality varies from person to person or culture to culture. 
    There is no universal "right answer". For example, in some Eskimo societies they beleive that the elderly should be honorably killed. This is a sign of respect 
    to reduce their suffering to to decrease the econimic burden that they may place on fellow citizens. But in other cultures failing to take proper care of the seniors 
    is selfish, as they once cared for the current generation when they were helpless infants. Which is correct for all cultures? In some areas of the world where resources 
    are much more scarce, the former would probably be judged as more "right" for that culture or scenario. An example of individual subjectivism could be a person's beleif on
    alcohol. For someone that has a genetic or behavioral disposition to misuse alcohol, abstenance would be the moral thing for that individual. However, it is not necessarily
    morally wrong for everyone else who has the discipline to drink in moderation to obstain. 
    <br><br>One of the strong arguments for relativism is that it encourages non-judgmental behavior. There is no room to critisize someone else's behavior or beleifs. It promotes understanding, tolerance,
    and individuality. Everyone is free to do what they feel is best for their circumstance. This also allows for culteral diversity. Different cultures have different moral codes, and there is no objective 
    way to determine which code is better or worse than others.
    One of the arguments against relativism points out that there would be no basis for moral criticism. For example, if someone beleived it to be morally just to kill your mother because she was ugly, there could be 
    no form of punishment or reconciliation. Everyone could do as they please on the basis of "following their heart", so to speak. Any moral belief or practice, no matter how harmful or unjust, could be defended on the 
    grounds that it is part of a particular culture or individuals' moral code. Additionally, this would undermine what we have considered as moral progress. For example, most beleive that the abolition of slavery was an
    improvement in our society. But this would be difficult to explain if one embraced relativism. Slavery could be restored with no justification to do otherwise. 
    <br><br>Objectivism is the belief that there are moral values that exist independent of individuals. These values can be discovered rationally and apply to everyone. This would solve the issues found in ethical relativism. Individuals 
    can be held accountable for their actions and be protected from one another. Of course then the question arises, what is it that we are supposed to do? What is the right and wrong thing to do? Philosophers have come up with many ideas 
    as to what they reason morality to be. There are two branches of thought: consequentialism and doentology.
</p>
<h3>Consequentialism</h3>
<p>This is the branch of thought that beleives that what is right is based on the consequences of the act. For example, if a Nazi soldier were to knock on your door and ask if you have Jews hiding in your basement, you would lie. This is because the consequences 
    of telling the truth would be the death of the innocent Jews that trusted you. This also means that intention or the act itself doesn't necessarily matter. What makes the act right is the effects of the act. 
</p>
<h3>Utilitarianism</h3>
<p>This is the belief that what is moral is what will create the most about of happiness amongst the most amount of people. </p>
