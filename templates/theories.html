<h2>What is ethics?</h2>
<p>Morals are the principles that govern what is right and wrong. Ethics is the action or rules that enact morality. 
    This can include behavior, thought, and/or intent. In philosophy, the study of ethics is our attempt to discover what 
    those rules of conduct should be in order to accurately encapsulate morality. Of course first we would need to understand the 
    nature of morality, which is still under debate. Philosophers have also framed this area of study in the form of the question, "what ought we to do?"
    </p>
<h3>Relativism verus Objectivism</h3>
<p>Of course one of the very first things to discuss is if we all even have to agree on morality. Some philosophers have claimed that morality is relative 
    to the individual (subjectivism) or group of individuals (cultural relativism). This means that morality varies from person to person or culture to culture. 
    There is no universal "right answer". For example, in some Eskimo societies they beleive that the elderly should be honorably killed. This is a sign of respect 
    to reduce their suffering to to decrease the econimic burden that they may place on fellow citizens. But in other cultures failing to take proper care of the seniors 
    is selfish, as they once cared for the current generation when they were helpless infants. Which is correct for all cultures? In some areas of the world where resources 
    are much more scarce, the former would probably be judged as more "right" for that culture or scenario. An example of individual subjectivism could be a person's beleif on
    alcohol. For someone that has a genetic or behavioral disposition to misuse alcohol, abstenance would be the moral thing for that individual. However, it is not necessarily
    morally wrong for everyone else who has the discipline to drink in moderation to obstain. 
    <br><br>One of the strong arguments for relativism is that it encourages non-judgmental behavior. There is no room to critisize someone else's behavior or beleifs. It promotes understanding, tolerance,
    and individuality. Everyone is free to do what they feel is best for their circumstance. This also allows for culteral diversity. Different cultures have different moral codes, and there is no objective 
    way to determine which code is better or worse than others.
    One of the arguments against relativism points out that there would be no basis for moral criticism. For example, if someone beleived it to be morally just to kill your mother because she was ugly, there could be 
    no form of punishment or reconciliation. Everyone could do as they please on the basis of "following their heart", so to speak. Any moral belief or practice, no matter how harmful or unjust, could be defended on the 
    grounds that it is part of a particular culture or individuals' moral code. Additionally, this would undermine what we have considered as moral progress. For example, most beleive that the abolition of slavery was an
    improvement in our society. But this would be difficult to explain if one embraced relativism. Slavery could be restored with no justification to do otherwise. 
    <br><br>Objectivism is the belief that there are moral values that exist independent of individuals. These values can be discovered rationally and apply to everyone. This would solve the issues found in ethical relativism. Individuals 
    can be held accountable for their actions and be protected from one another. Of course then the question arises, what is it that we are supposed to do? What is the right and wrong thing to do? Philosophers have come up with many ideas 
    as to what they reason morality to be. There are two branches of thought: consequentialism and doentology.
</p>
<h3>Consequentialism</h3>
<p>This is the branch of thought that beleives that what is right is based on the consequences of the act. For example, if a Nazi soldier were to knock on your door and ask if you have Jews hiding in your basement, you would lie. This is because the consequences 
    of telling the truth would be the death of the innocent Jews that trusted you. This also means that intention or the act itself doesn't necessarily matter. What makes the act right is the effects of the act. 
</p>
<h3>Utilitarianism</h3>
<p>Utilitarianism is a moral theory that evaluates the ethical worth of an action based on its ability to maximize happiness or pleasure and minimize pain or suffering for the greatest number of people. According to this theory, the best course of action is the one that produces the greatest amount of overall happiness or pleasure, and the least amount of overall suffering or pain.
    This means that some acts that may be deemed as immoral would be permissable if it is net positive in its effects. For example, if there was a man who was the only one that knew the passcode to stop an atomic bomb from destroying New York, it would be permissable to torture him to get those codes. This is because the pain from his toture is less than the pain that will be caused 
    by killing millions of innocent civilians. It also allows for lying by telling your wife that the dress does not make her look fat...
</p>
<br>
<p>Critics of utilitarianism argue that it can lead to morally problematic decisions if the happiness of the majority is achieved at the expense of (1)the minority or (2) if the happiness of future generations is disregarded. The first objection is less prominent in large societies. However, utilitarianism can be 
    very harmful to a few people. For example, it would allow for slavery and other foul behaviors, as long as the benefit outweighs the cost. Second, it only worries about the pain/happiness of the now or nearby future. It does not have any regards for far into the future. For example, we could destroy the environment
    for our benefit, even though it could cause suffering and exstinctions a few hundred years from now.
</p>
<h3>Egoism</h3>
<p>Ethical egoism is a moral theory that holds that individuals should act in their own self-interest, seeking to maximize their own happiness or pleasure, regardless of the impact on others. According to this theory, each person has a moral obligation to pursue their own self-interest, even if it conflicts with the interests of others.
    Some proponents of ethical egoism argue that it can lead to a more peaceful and prosperous society, as individuals who pursue their own self-interest will be more productive and efficient. They argue that individuals who act in their own self-interest will naturally cooperate with others, as cooperation can often lead to greater mutual benefit.
</p>
<p>It is important to note the difference between ethical and psychological egoism. 
    Ethical egoism is prescriptive in nature, as it tells individuals what they ought to do. It is concerned with how people should behave in order to lead a good and moral life. 
    Psychological egoism, on the other hand, is a descriptive theory of human motivation that asserts that people always act in their own self-interest, regardless of whether they are aware of it or not. It is concerned with how people actually behave, 
    rather than how they should behave. Psychological egoism holds that individuals always do pursue their own self-interest, whether they are aware of it or not. It is descriptive in nature, as it describes how people behave, rather than prescribing how they should behave. 
    If psychological egoism is indeed the case, then there would be no escaping ethical egoism. This is because if someone were to claim to be acting under, say, virtue ethics and trying to be selfless, this would not be the case and would be actually acting under their own interest.
    Thus the only ethical theory that would be possible to live by would be ethical egoism.
</p>
<br>
<p>One of the main criticisms of ethical egoism is that it does not take into account the interests of others, which can lead to selfish and harmful behavior. Critics argue that it is important to consider the interests of others in making moral decisions, and that the pursuit of self-interest should not come at the expense of the well-being of others.</p>
<h3>Social Contract Theory</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Deontology</h3>
<p>This is the branch in ethics that includes theories that focus on the ethical principles and duties that guide human action, rather than on the consequences of those actions. In other words, it focuses on the act itself rather than the effects or outcome of the act. 
    According to deontological ethics, there are certain moral rules and duties that are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their consequences.
    Deontologists believe that actions are intrinsically right or wrong based on whether they adhere to universal moral principles or duties, such as the duty to tell the truth or the duty to respect the autonomy of others. These principles and duties are seen as objectively true 
    and binding on all individuals, regardless of their personal preferences or circumstances.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Critics of deontological ethics argue that it can be rigid and inflexible, and that it may not always provide clear guidance for ethical decision-making in complex situations. They also argue that it may not take into account the consequences of actions, which can be an important factor in determining whether an action is morally right or wrong.</p>
