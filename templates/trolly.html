            question: "Imagine that you are in a train yard. There is a set of tracks and a lever in front of you. The tracks fork in a Y shape. On the left are five workers and on the right is one worker. You look behind you and see a trolly car thundering uncontrolably down the tracks. You see that unless you pull the switch lever in front of you, it will go down the left track and kill the five workers. But if you pull the lever, it'll switch the track and kill the one person instead. Do you pull the lever to switch the track?",
            a: "Yes, it is better to kill one than to kill five",
            b: "Yes, it would be my responsability to save the five",
            c: "No, if I pull the lever that it means I will be held responsible for the one death.",
            d: "No, because it is wrong to kill even one person, despite the consequences. If I don't pull the lever, then I wouldn't be actually killing the five.",
            e: "Yes, because I want to be someone that saves people.",

You know that if you push the fat man in front of the trolly car it will kill him, but it will save the five workers. Do you push the fat man?",
            a: "Yes, it would still be better to kill one person than two",
            b: "No, because it would make me a killer to push him with my bare hands",
            c: "No, because I would probably go to jail or get in trouble for killing the fat man, whereas I would not get in trouble for not pushing him",
            d: "No, because I should not use a person as a tool or object, even if it is to help other people.",
            e: "Yes, because my intent is still to save the five people",

            a: "Yes, because it still doesn't matter how he dies as long as it saves the five",
            b: "Yes, because pushing a button makes me feel less guilty than pushing him with my bare hands",
            c: "Yes, because I would see myself as less of a killer than pushing him with my bare hands",
            d: "No, because no matter how he is killed, I am still using him as an object",
            e: "No, because I would still be killing someone, which is always wrong",
            f: "No, because killing someone, even if it was so save other people, would negatively impact my character. Even if it wasn't my bare hands, I would still be a killer",

This time the one person is a doctor who will go on to cure cancer and save millions. Would you still switch the track to kill the one?",
            a: "Yes, because people have intrinsic value so one person cannot be valued over another person",
            b: "Yes, because five people is still more than one",
            c: "Yes, because I don't know for sure that the doctor will cure cancer",
